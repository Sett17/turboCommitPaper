# Abstract

Conventional commit messages play a vital role in maintaining a clear and well-structured version control history in software development.
However, writing informative and consistent commit messages can be challenging and time-consuming for developers.
This paper presents `turbocommit`, a novel tool that leverages the power of AI to generate conventional commit messages from git diffs.
Utilizing the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model, `turbocommit` aims to streamline the software development process by automating commit message creation and ensuring compliance with the Conventional Commits specification.
The paper delves into the development process, including requirement analysis, implementation, and evaluation of the tool.
We compare the performance of AI-generated commit messages with manually written ones in terms of accuracy, readability, and adherence to the specification.

<!-- My findings suggest that AI-driven tools like `turbocommit` have the potential to significantly enhance the software development process, particularly in the context of version control management. -->
