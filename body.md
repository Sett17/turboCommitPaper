# Comparison

In this section, compare the AI-generated commit messages with the human-written conventional commit messages based on the criteria you identified. You can organize this section using either the block or point-by-point method.


- Block Method: You could discuss the AI-generated commit messages first, covering each criterion, and then move on to the human-written conventional commit messages, covering each criterion again. This approach might be more useful if you want to highlight the differences between the two types of messages.

- Point-by-Point Method: You could compare the AI-generated commit messages and the human-written conventional commit messages side by side for each criterion. This approach might be more useful if you want to compare the similarities and differences between the two types of messages in a more detailed way.
