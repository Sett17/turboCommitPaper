# Introduction

Commit messages play a crucial role in software development by maintaining a clear and well-structured version control history.
However, developers often face difficulties in creating consistent and informative commit messages, which can hinder the efficiency of the development process.
In this paper, we introduce `turbocommit`, a tool that harnesses the power of AI, specifically the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model, to generate conventional commit messages from git diffs.
The primary aim of `turbocommit` is to streamline the software development process by automating commit message creation and ensuring adherence to the Conventional Commits specification.

The objective of this term paper is to show the development process, requirements, and evaluation of `turbocommit`.
We will compare the performance of AI-generated commit messages with manually written ones using various metrics, such as accuracy, readability, and compliance with the Conventional Commits specification.

<!-- The paper is structured as follows: In the Theory section, we will explore relevant technologies, such as git, Conventional Commits, and the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model.
We will also discuss the requirements and constraints for building `turbocommit` and the theory behind measuring its \[...\].
The Method section will elaborate on the implementation of `turbocommit` and the rationale behind the decisions made during the development process.
In the Results section, we will present the measured results, showcasing the performance of AI-generated commit messages compared to \[...\] ones.
Finally, in the Discussion section, we will interpret the results, discuss the implications of `turbocommit`, address its limitations, and suggest areas for future work or improvements. -->
