# Introduction

Commit messages play a crucial role in software development by maintaining a clear and well-structured version control history.
However, developers often face difficulties in creating consistent and informative commit messages, which can hinder the efficiency of the development process.
In this paper, we introduce `turbocommit`, a tool that harnesses the power of AI, specifically the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model, to generate conventional commit messages from git diffs.
The primary aim of `turbocommit` is to streamline the software development process by automating commit message creation and ensuring adherence to the Conventional Commits specification.

The objective of this term paper is to show the development process, requirements, and evaluation of `turbocommit`.
We will compare the performance of AI-generated commit messages with manually written ones using various metrics, such as accuracy, readability, and compliance with the Conventional Commits specification.
