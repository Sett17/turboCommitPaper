# Criteria

Identify the criteria you will be using to compare the AI-generated commit messages with the human-written conventional
commit messages. Some possible criteria could include the clarity of the message, the consistency of the message with
the code changes, and the effectiveness of the message in communicating the purpose of the code changes.
